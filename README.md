Capstone Project – School Attendance Analysis
This repository contains the code and data for my capstone project at Quantic.

Files
capstone.R
Main analysis script. This file reads the input data, performs cleaning and transformations, produces summary tables/plots, and creates the final outputs used in the capstone report.

workspace.zip
Zipped R workspace (workspace.RData) containing the objects created during the analysis. This is provided as a convenience so the project can be inspected without rerunning all code.

*.csv files
Raw and intermediate data used in the analysis (for example: Student_Attendance.csv, Guest.csv, Location.csv, etc.). These are the inputs that capstone.R expects.

admin_heatmap.png
Example visualization generated by the script.

How to run the code
Download or clone this repository.

Open RStudio and set the working directory to the repository folder.

Ensure the required packages are installed (for example: tidyverse, readr, dplyr, ggplot2).

Open capstone.R and run it from top to bottom.

The script assumes the CSV files are in the same folder as capstone.R (or in the data subfolder, if you move them there—update the file paths in the script accordingly).

Using the saved workspace (optional)
Instead of rerunning the entire script, you can load the saved workspace:

r
load("workspace.RData")  # after unzipping workspace.zip
This will restore the key data frames and objects used in the analysis.

Project description
This capstone analyzes SCHOOL / DISTRICT attendance and related events for the 2018–2019 school year. The goals are to:

Describe attendance patterns across students, guests, and locations.

Identify events or factors associated with changes in attendance.

Produce visualizations and summary statistics that support the findings in the written capstone report.
